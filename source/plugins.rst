Plugins
=======

PieMC can be extended and customized with plugins.

A plugin is an external module which can be "plugged in" to your server to add custom features, change default behaviours and more.

Downloading plugins
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You can find a wide range of premade plugins on the `Release <https://PieMC-Dev.github.io/releases>`_ plugin platform.

Installing/updating a plugin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Plugin developers usually distribute plugins as `python <https://docs.python.org/3.11/library/index.html>`_ files. These files can be easily loaded by placing them in your ``plugins`` folder in the server data folder.

Be sure to **delete old versions of the plugin**, and **restart the server** to see changes.

Writing your own plugins
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You can find resources for plugin development at the `DevHub site <https://PieMC.github.io/DevHub>`_.
